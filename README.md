Just as Thomas Edison said:
>“I have not failed.
>I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”


For this project I was given an HTML code and had to edit it using CSS and making no changed to the original HTML.

This is what i've learned while solving this problem:

#CSS
* How floats interact with other elements on a page.
* How to properly use margins, borders, and padding to adjust elements on a page.
* How to use the clear element to make text or other images flow around each other.
* How to use border-radius to round the edges of images on a page.

#Bonus
* Training my brain to read HTML that was not written by myself.
